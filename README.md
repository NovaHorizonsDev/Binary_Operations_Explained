About<br />
This project focuses on being able to express Real Analysis principles as java code( mainly binary operations on so far: naturals and integers with plans\current development on rationals.
Topics include: <br />
-Addition(and inverses)
-multiplication(and inverse)
-exponentiaton

Note: due to current limited stack size, some work arounds were made and current development to expand stack is underway. 

<br />
On top of that, a process to evaluate finite sets  under an operation (mainly addition and multiplication as of right now) to determine whether the set is a group.
